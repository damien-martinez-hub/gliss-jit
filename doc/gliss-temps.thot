====== Generation Templates ======

@(GLISS) uses a template system in order to generate C sources of
an ISS. This system allows to get maximum flexibility and customisation
in generation. It allows also to have a C-close view of the sources
and to propose different generation modes. In addition, users may easily
modify the used symbol in order to meet their needs.


===== Template System =====

Basically, a template is a text file containing C sources augmented
with @(GLISS) template system syntax. Templates files are used by
''gep'' or other @(GLISS) commands to perform the generation of sources.
These templates are located in the ''templates/'' @(GLISS) directory.

==== Textual Symbols ====

The main item of the template system is a symbol that may be anywhere
in the source file and have the following syntax:

<code>
TemplateCommands ::= TemplateSymbol
TemplateSymbol ::= '$' '(' IDENTIFIER ')'
</code>

When processed by the template system, the symbol is looked
in a dictionnary provided by the generator command the found text
replaces the symbol invocation.

For example, the ''proc'' symbol may used to renamed ISS functions as
in the excerpt of ''api.h'' below:
<code c>
$(proc)_inst_t *$(proc)_next_inst($(proc)_sim_t *sim);
void $(proc)_step($(proc)_sim_t *sim);
int $(proc)_is_sim_ended($(proc)_sim_t *sim);
</code>

This basic behaviour is provided by a symbol of type text and may be used
for simple text generation or replacement (the text is not fixed and
may be generated according the processed NML description).

Other types of symbols allows to iterate on collections of NML items
(registers, memories, instructions, parameters and so on) while other
ones are evaluated as boolean and allows to perform conditional generation
of code.

==== Collection Symbols ====

To iterate on a collection symbol, the ''foreach'' statement must be
used:
<code>
TemplateCommands ::‚Åº TemplateForeach
TemplateForeach ::= '$(foreach' IDENTIFIER ')' TEXT '$(end)'
</code>

The text in the ''foreach'' commands is repeated for each item of
the collection matching the identifier. The text may contain other
template commands and the used dictionnary is extended with symbols
specific to the collecion items.

The excerpt below, from disassembly template, shows the ''foreach'' usage:
<code c>
$(foreach instructions)
static void disasm_$(IDENT)(char *__buffer, $(proc)_inst_t *inst) {
	$(disassemble)
}
$(end)
</code>

The ''instructions'' symbols provides the collection of instructions
and each instruction provides the ''disassemble'' symbol. Notice that
the latter symbol is only visible in the ''foreach'' statement.

==== Conditional Symbols ====

Finally, some symbols are of type boolean and may be used to generate
sources according some conditions if they are used in conditional
statement.

<code>
TemplateCommands ::= TemplateIf
TemplateIf ::= '$(if' TemplateCondition ')' TEXT '$(end)'
           |   '$(if' TemplateCondition ')' TEXT '$(else)' '$(end)'
TemplateCondition ::= IDENTIFIER | '!' IDENTIFIER
</code>

In the first form, the text in the condition is only generated is
if the condition evaluates to true. The second form meets same semantics
except if the condition evaluates to false, only the text following
the ''else'' statement is generated.

The template condition may be a boolean identifier that evaluates to
true if the identifier is equals to true or it may be preceded by
a ''!'' indicating an inversion of condition.

The example below is extracted from ''api.h'' and perform the state
data structure definition:
<code c>
typedef struct $(proc)_state_t {
	$(proc)_platform_t *platform;
$(foreach registers)$(if !aliased)$(if array)
	$(type) $(name)[$(size)];
$(else)
	$(type) $(name);
$(end)$(end)$(end)
$(foreach memories)$(if !aliased)
	$(proc)_memory_t *$(NAME);
$(end)$(end)
} $(proc)_state_t;
</code>

It contains a double condition. The first one says that only unaliased
registers are declared: there is no ''else'' part. In the second one,
we use two ways to generate the register declaration according if they
are arrays or not.


===== Symbols and Templates =====

This section describes the set of standard symbols. They are sorted
according to the template they are used in and to the collection items
they are defined in.

In addition, they are suffixed by their type that may be:
  * //text// for textual symbols,
  * //collect// for collection symbols,
  * //bool// for boolean symbols.


==== Standard Symbols ====

These symbols are defined whatever the used template.

=== Top Level ===

''date'' (//text//) -- current date including days and hours (useful
to know when a source has been generated)

''INCLUDE_PATH'' (//text//) -- path to the generated include header files

''instruction'' (//collect//) -- collection of NML instruction
(fully derived)

''profiled_instructions'' (//collect//) -- collection of 'n' profiled NML instruction more details in section optimisation.

''GLISS_PROFILED_JUMPS'' (//bool//) -- True when option '-PJ nb_instr' is activated in GEP more details ins section optimisation.

''max_operand_nb'' (//text//) -- Indicates the maximum number of operands of the NML instruction set.

''total_instruction_count'' (//text//) -- Total number of NML instruction set.

''memories'' (//collect//) -- collection of used memories
(''mem'' NML statement)

''params'' (//collect//) -- collection of existing parameter types
(built the union of the parameters types of the different instructions).

''proc'' (//text//) -- processor name in lowercase, derived from
the NML ''proc'' definition

''PROC'' (//text//) -- processor name in uppercase, derived from
the NML ''proc'' definition

''registers'' (//collect//) -- collection of used registers

''SOURCE_PATH'' (//text//) -- path to the generated sources

''values'' (//collect//) -- collection of the different types of all the parameters from every fully derived instructions,
types are all "rounded" to the smallest C type that can contain them

''version'' (//text//) -- identification of the generation version
of @(GLISS)
